#Tom's BeagleBone 'Environment'
*A very barebones (beaglebone), build and deployment system*

My current environemnt for hobby projects. Uses make as a build system for cross compiling and deploying binaries to a beaglebone black over a LAN.

Requires the `gcc` extensions for arm compilation along with `make` and `ssh`.
